# My Portfolio 3.0 üéâ

Check out my new portfolio! 1st attempt was using CSS and HTMl and less than a handful of lines of JavaScript. 2nd attempt was using more JavaScript to animate the page more and give it some cool effects. This third time I decided to build it using Next.js as it seems to be a very popular framework and some new tools to go along with it. 

## Motivation

Thought my portfolio could use a makeover and it seems like a pretty small project to begin using Next.js. I believe that with even this slight makeover, it can draw more attention to myself and better display my skills and progress through a nice and clean UI. This inspiration was taken from [chronark.com](https://chronark.com/) as this was an example from the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) website. 

## Main Technologies ‚ö°Ô∏è

- `Next.js`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Upstash`
- `Contentlayer`

## Project Dependencies

This section is more for my sake as I will be using new dependencies I have never worked with so I am detailing the use for each below:

*Note: descriptions are directly from NPM website*

- `@next/font`: includes a built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero layout shift, thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust property used. 
- `@next/mdx`: use MDX with Next.js
- `@upstash/redis`: is an HTTP/REST based Redis client built for typescript, built on top of Upstash REST API
- `contentlayer`: is a content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data you can easily *import* into your application's pages
- `framer-motion`: an open source motion library for React, made by Framer
- `lucide-react`: implementation of the lucide icon library for react applications
- `markdown-wasm`: very fast Markdown & HTML renderer implemented in WebAssembly
- `next-contentlayer`
- `react-wrap-balancer`: simple React component that makes titles more readable
- `rehype-autolink-headings`: rehype plugin to add links from headings back to themselves
- `rehype-pretty-code`: beautiful code blocks for your MD/MDX docs
- `rehype-slug`: rehype plugin to add *ids* to headings
- `remark-gfm`: remark plugin to support GFM (autolink, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
